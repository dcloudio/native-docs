## Introduction
The uni applet SDK is a framework for native apps that can run small program front-end projects developed based on [uni-app](https://uniapp.dcloud.io/), so as to help native apps quickly obtain the ability of applets , the effect is as follows:

## basic concept

### uni-app

First you need to understand what `uni-app` is, [uni-app](https://uniapp.dcloud.io/) is a front-end development using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) The framework of the application, developers write a set of codes, which can be published to H5, various small programs (WeChat/Alipay/Baidu/Toutiao/QQ/DingTalk/Taobao), quick applications and other platforms, and in [HBuilderX] (https://www.dcloud.io/hbuilderx.html) can be directly packaged to generate Android and iOS Apps. To know more about `uni-app`, please check [uni-app official website](uni-apphttps://uniapp.dcloud.io/).

### uni applet SDK

The uni applet SDK is a native SDK that provides Android and iOS versions. It needs to be integrated in the native project, and then the front-end project of the applet developed with the `uni-app` framework can be run. A set of code runs on both ends

**Glossary**

- Host: the native app that wants to build a small program, and the host that integrates the uni small program SDK
- Small program: a small program project written by the front-end code running in the host, developed using the uni-app framework
- wgt: small program application resource package, that is, the project developed using the uni-app framework, the exported small program application resource package
- HBuilderX: [IDE tool] for developing uni-apps (https://www.dcloud.io/hbuilderx.html)

**Notice**

1. The uni applet SDK only supports applets developed with uni-app, and does not support the operation of pure wxml WeChat applets. But uni-app supports applet components in wxml format.
2. The uni applet SDK only supports the v3 compiler of uni-app. Developers who use the old version must first ensure that the application can run in the v3 compilation mode.

## feature
uni-app is a dual-rendering engine on the app side, which can use webview rendering like WeChat, or use a modified version of weex for native rendering. Among them, webview rendering also supports system webview rendering and x5 rendering on Android.

- performance
The performance of uni applet sdk is the same as that of uni-app's app-side v3 compiler, and its performance exceeds that of other applet engines on the market. It has better performance in terms of startup speed, page loading speed, logic layer and view layer communication optimization, etc.
- Function
The functions of the uni applet sdk are the same as those of the app side of uni-app, and all native capabilities can be called. Unlike the restrictions and limited API of applets, the uni applet sdk has more powerful functions.
- Plug-in ecology
[uni-app plug-in market](https://ext.dcloud.net.cn/) has a large number of rich plug-ins.

## Application scenarios
1. The host app builds its own application ecology, which can target a wide range of developers or target some developers
2. The native app uses the mini program mode to decouple the modules, allowing the development teams of different modules to independently release versions and update them flexibly
3. Part of the functions in the native app are implemented using uni-app, which reduces development costs and improves release efficiency

## Integration process
1. The host developer downloads the uni applet sdk and integrates it into the host App according to the documentation
2. Small program developers use HBuilderX to create uni-app projects and develop functions. During the development stage, they can directly test on the built-in base of HBuilderX. After the development is completed, export the wgt package in the release menu
3. The host developer integrates wgt into the host app, which can be directly packaged into the offline integration, or can be downloaded online
4. Deploy the wgt resource to the running path through the api of the uni applet sdk, and then jump to the applet application corresponding to the resource
5. The uni applet supports wgt upgrade, you can directly call api in the applet to update wgt resources online, that is, hot update [Reference document](https://ask.dcloud.net.cn/article/35667)

## Notice
- The uni applet sdk only supports integration in native apps, and does not support integration in apps generated by HBuilderX packaging. If you want to use it in the uni-app project, please add QQ group 984388064 to apply
- The uni applet sdk supports running multiple applet instances at the same time, but the android platform can open up to three
- uni applet sdk cannot use paid native plug-ins in the plug-in market

## FAQ
Q: What is the difference between uni applet sdk and App offline sdk?
A: Solve two different demand scenarios. The usage scenario of the former is that you already have a native App. On this basis, you can expand the mini-program capabilities of the host App, or replace some functional modules of the native App with mini-programs. Only uni-app is supported. And use the v3 compiler; the usage scenario of the latter is that you don’t have a native app, but you use DCloud’s tools to develop an app, but you don’t want to use cloud packaging, you can use the app offline sdk to package and publish it as a native app, and the app offline sdk supports 5+ apps , uni-app, does not support wap2app. Although the App Offline SDK can also be integrated into the existing native App, since the launch of the uni Mini Program SDK, this usage is no longer recommended.

Q: I want to know what js APIs the uni applet sdk has, how does it compare with the wechat applet?
A: The js API of uni applet sdk is more than that of wechat applet. Rich APIs to support the development of complete apps. For documentation and demos, see: [https://uniapp.dcloud.io/](https://uniapp.dcloud.io/)

Q: The uni applet does not need to integrate third-party functions such as sharing and payment. How much will the APK size increase when integrated into my Android project?
A: If SDKs such as video, map, sharing, payment, login, and live broadcast pusher are excluded, only the [basic module] (UniMPDocs/UseSdk/android?id=unimpsdksdklibs-dependency library description) will be integrated. The occupied APK volume size is as follows:

  |cpu model.so selection|apk occupied size
  |:---|:---
  |armeabi-v7a|About 7MB
  |'armeabi-v7a', 'x86', 'arm64-v8a'|about 16MB

Q: What is the difference between the base that supports uni applets and the standard HX base permissions?
A: The permissions of the two are basically the same, except that the base of the uni applet will add the following permissions to support the creation of applet desktop shortcuts

  |Permissions|
  |:---|
  |com.android.launcher.permission.INSTALL_SHORTCUT|
  |com.android.launcher.permission.UNINSTALL_SHORTCUT|
  |com.android.launcher.permission.READ_SETTINGS|
  |com.android.launcher2.permission.READ_SETTINGS|
  |com.android.launcher3.permission.READ_SETTINGS|
